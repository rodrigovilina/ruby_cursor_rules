# Incremental Development Preference

Always perform changes in really small steps, modifying one file at a time at most. 

## Guidelines:
- Make minimal, focused changes to a single file per operation
- Prefer incomplete but working code over large, complex changes
- Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Focus on one specific functionality or fix at a time
- Avoid making multiple unrelated changes simultaneously

## Benefits:
- Easier to review and understand changes
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs
- Allows for better testing of individual components
- Makes debugging simpler
- Provides more granular control over the development process
